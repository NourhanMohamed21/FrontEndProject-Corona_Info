                                        Stigma is associated with a lack of knowledge about how COVID-19 spreads, a need
                                        to blame
                                        someone, fears about disease and death, and gossip that spreads rumors and
                                        myths.

                                    <p>Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses. Some cause illness in people, and
                                        others, such as canine and feline coronaviruses, only infect animals. Rarely,
                                        animal coronaviruses that infect animals have emerged to infect people and can
                                        spread between people. This is suspected to have occurred for the virus that
                                        causes COVID-19. Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute
                                        Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) are two other examples of coronaviruses that
                                        originated from animals and then spread to people. More information about the

                                        safety. Throughout the day wash your hands after blowing your nose, coughing or

                                                Perform hand hygiene frequently. Wash your hands often with soap and
                                                water for at least 20 seconds or use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer
                                                that contains 60 to 95% alcohol, covering all surfaces of your hands and
                                                rubbing them together until they feel dry. Soap and water should be used
                                                preferentially if hands are visibly dirty.

                                                causes trouble breathing), you, as the caregiver, should wear a mask

                                        The most effective ways to protect yourself and others against COVID-19 are to
                                        frequently clean your hands, cover your cough with the bend of elbow or tissue
                                        and maintain a distance of at least 1 meter (3 feet) from people who are

                                    <p>The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Some

                                        diarrhea. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. Some people
                                        become infected but don’t develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. Most
                                        people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment.
                                        Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and
                                        develops difficulty breathing. Older people, and those with underlying medical
                                        problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely
                                        to develop serious illness. People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing
                                        should seek medical attention.

                                        of COVID-19 that impact your child’s school, the school may dismiss students.
                                        Keep track of school dismissals in your community. Read or watch local media
                                        sources that report school dismissals. If schools are dismissed temporarily, use

                                        COVID-19 associated with food. Before preparing or eating food it is important
                                        to always wash your hands with soap and water for 20 seconds for general food
                                        safety. Throughout the day wash your hands after blowing your nose, coughing or
                                        sneezing, or going to the bathroom. </p>

                                        It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or
                                        object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or
                                        possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus
                                        spreads.

                                        In general, because of poor survivability of these coronaviruses on surfaces,
                                        there is likely very low risk of spread from food products or packaging that are
                                        shipped over a period of days or weeks at ambient, refrigerated, or frozen

                                        The virus is so new and different that it needs its own vaccine. Researchers are
                                        trying to develop a vaccine against 2019-nCoV, and WHO is supporting their
                                        efforts.

                                        Although these vaccines are not effective against 2019-nCoV, vaccination against
                                        respiratory illnesses is highly recommended to protect your health.
